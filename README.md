# D2D Adapter Verilog Implementation

This repository contains the Verilog RTL design of the D2D Adapter module, along with a Cocotb-based Python testbench and simulation setup.

## Files Description

- `D2DAdapter.v` – Main Verilog source file implementing the D2D Adapter functionality.
- `test_d2d_adapter.py` – Cocotb-based Python testbench to verify the D2D Adapter module through simulation.
- `Makefile` – Makefile to automate the simulation process using Cocotb.
